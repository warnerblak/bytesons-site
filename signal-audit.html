    <!-- INTRO -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What this is</h2>
      <p>
        Most decisions in NFTs are made under pressure. Price movement, social momentum, urgency, and noise distort
        judgment — especially when information is incomplete. The Signal Framework exists to slow that process down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of reacting to hype or price, it focuses on <strong>signals that persist over time</strong>: structure,
        behavior, incentives, and unknowns. These signals change slowly, are harder to manipulate, and provide clearer
        context for decision-making.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        Signal is not prediction. Signal is not certainty. Signal is what remains observable when noise is removed.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- DEFINITION -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What we mean by “signal”</h2>
      <p>
        Signal refers to non-price information that reflects <strong>intent, consistency, and risk</strong> over time.
        These signals don’t tell you what will happen — they help you understand what you are agreeing to accept.
      </p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>How long projects and founders have existed</li>
        <li>How consistently they communicate</li>
        <li>How incentives are framed</li>
        <li>How much is known versus unknown</li>
        <li>How much flexibility or authority is retained</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <hr class="divider" />

    <!-- WHY -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why this exists</h2>
      <p>
        Most losses in NFTs don’t come from bad intentions. They come from committing too quickly, misunderstanding risk,
        confusing momentum with durability, and accepting unknowns without realizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Signal Framework exists to make those unknowns visible <strong>before</strong> commitment.
      </p>
    </section>

    <hr class="divider" />

    <!-- DOES NOT -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What this framework does not do</h2>
      <p class="muted">These tools are designed to support clearer thinking — not safer bets.</p>

      <ul class="list">
        <li>It does not recommend purchases</li>
        <li>It does not predict outcomes</li>
        <li>It does not rank projects</li>
        <li>It does not assign value</li>
        <li>It does not remove risk</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The decision — and the risk — always remains with the individual.

    <!-- TOOLS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>The Signal Tools</h2>
      <p class="muted">
        Each tool applies the Signal Framework in a different context. Calm, readable, and chain-aware without being
        chain-dependent.
      </p>

      <!-- Tool: Signal Audit -->
      <article class="card">
        <h3 class="card-title">Signal Audit</h3>
        <p class="muted">Observing persistence</p>
        <p>
          Signal Audit observes how a collection behaves once noise is removed — focusing on structure, behavior, and time
          rather than price or hype.
        </p>
        <ul class="list">
          <li><strong>Structural</strong> signals: visual coherence, distribution, palette</li>
          <li><strong>Behavioral</strong> signals: holding patterns, presence, churn</li>
          <li><strong>Temporal</strong> signals: what persists across time</li>

    <!-- WHY BYTESONS -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Why Bytesons built this</h2>
      <p>
        Bytesons has lived through multiple cycles, long periods of silence, and real on-chain exposure. That experience
        informs how these tools are built.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are designed primarily to help Bytesons holders navigate the space with more clarity, less urgency, and
        lower emotional cost — regardless of chain.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        The tools are not gated because clarity improves when shared. Bytesons remains the home base. The framework
        extends outward.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- CLOSING -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>A final note</h2>
      <p>
        These tools don’t remove risk. They make risk visible.
      </p>
      <p class="muted">
        And visibility is often the difference between a considered decision and a costly one.
